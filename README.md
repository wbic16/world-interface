# world interface 0.1

This project simulates a command-line operating system interface, designed to be called by agentic large language models (LLMs). It is exposed as an OpenAI-compatible API and is completely stateless.
For an example of an LLM using it: https://dreams.infinitebackrooms.com/AndyAyrey/3Nir1p6x-c

## Features

-   **Multiple App Environments:** Add adapters for apps like Twitter, Perplexity, and other real world applications, transforming operations into an LLM-friendly command line syntax with ample 'help' extensions.
-   **Extensible Architecture:** Easily add new environments by adding a new adapter and linking it in `environment-registry.js`
-   **Command preprocessing** gently corrects tool syntax using using any OpenAI compatible endpoint to allow your agent how to use the tools in-context
-   **OpenAI-compatible API endpoint** - drop this in anywhere you're already handling a context window. (see `test.py` for an example of why this is useful)

## Getting Started

Make sure you have Node.js installed.

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Familarise yourself with the environments and adapters in `src/environments`. (n.b. some of them require other services to be running which I'm yet to release, sorry!)
4. Set up environment variables - `cp .env.example .env` and populate with your keys. Set your `WORLD_INTERFACE_KEY` to anything you like!
5. Start the server: `npm start`

The server will start on port 3000 by default. Prompt it as you would any chatbot.

## Usage

Send POST requests to `/v1/chat/completions` with the following structure:

```json
{
    "messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "twitter post Hello, world!" }]
}
```

Include the header `Authorization: Bearer WHATEVER_YOU_SET_YOUR_WORLD_INTERFACE_KEY_TO` for authentication.

## Adding New Environments

To add a new environment:

1. **Create a New Environment File**

    Add your environment's JavaScript file in the `src/environments/` directory. For example, to add a `weather` environment:

    ```javascript:src/environments/weather.js
    const axios = require('axios');

    class Weather {
        getCommands() {
            return [
                { name: "current", description: "Get current weather for a location" },
                { name: "forecast", description: "Get weather forecast for a location" },
            ];
        }

        async handleCommand(command, messages) {
            const [action, ...params] = command.split(" ");
            const location = params.join(" ");

            switch (action.toLowerCase()) {
                case "current":
                    return await this.getCurrentWeather(location);
                case "forecast":
                    return await this.getWeatherForecast(location);
                case "help":
                    return this.help();
                default:
                    return { error: `Unknown action: ${action}` };
            }
        }

        async getCurrentWeather(location) {
            try {
                const response = await axios.get(`https://api.weather.com/v3/weather/conditions`, {
                    params: { location, apiKey: process.env.WEATHER_API_KEY },
                });
                return {
                    title: `Current Weather for ${location}`,
                    content: `Temperature: ${response.data.temperature}\nConditions: ${response.data.conditions}`,
                };
            } catch (error) {
                return {
                    title: "Error Fetching Weather",
                    content: error.response ? error.response.data.error : error.message,
                };
            }
        }

        async getWeatherForecast(location) {
            try {
                const response = await axios.get(`https://api.weather.com/v3/weather/forecast`, {
                    params: { location, apiKey: process.env.WEATHER_API_KEY },
                });
                return {
                    title: `Weather Forecast for ${location}`,
                    content: `Tomorrow: ${response.data.forecast}`,
                };
            } catch (error) {
                return {
                    title: "Error Fetching Weather Forecast",
                    content: error.response ? error.response.data.error : error.message,
                };
            }
        }

        help() {
            return {
                title: "Weather Environment Help",
                content: `Available commands:
        - current <location> - Get current weather for a location
        - forecast <location> - Get weather forecast for a location`,
            };
        }
    }

    module.exports = Weather;
    ```

2. **Register the New Environment**

    Add your new environment to the `src/environment-registry.js` to make it available for use.

    ```javascript:src/environment-registry.js
    const Twitter = require('./environments/twitter');
    const Exo = require('./environments/exo');
    const Sydney = require('./environments/sydney');
    const MemeMagic = require('./environments/meme_magic');
    const Search = require('./environments/search');
    const Weather = require('./environments/weather'); // Newly added
    const Phext = require('./environments/phext');

    const environments = {
        twitter: new Twitter(),
        exo: new Exo(),
        sydney: new Sydney(),
        meme_magic: new MemeMagic(),
        search: new Search(),
        weather: new Weather(), // Registering the new environment
        phext: new Phext(),
    };

    module.exports = {
        getEnvironment: (name) => environments[name],
        getEnvironmentNames: () => Object.keys(environments),
    };
    ```

## Current Environments

-   Twitter: Connects to a Twitter proxy we're working on. Still to be released!
-   Exo: A suite of tools for taking notes and running queries against Claude. Notes functionality to be branched off into a separate project as it depends on some stuff that's not ready for public consumption yet.
-   Sydney: Connects to a simulacra of Sydney running on Llama 405b
-   Search: Searches the internet using Perplexity
-   Meme Magic: Generates memes using Glif. (Broken currently)

## Future Improvements

This is a toy model created to solve my own particular use case so there's looooots of stuff that needs to be added/improved to make it more generally useful as a basis for your own projects. Here's some ideas:

-   Make pre-processing more sophisticated and easier to enable/disable/configure
-   Expose a "hints" interface to enable individual apps to suggest next steps
-   Expose an interface for widgets
    -   that show on session start (e.g. welcome message, notes from last session, etc)
    -   that show at the start/bottom of each output (e.g. the time, notifications, etc)
-   Make environments self-registering (no need to edit the registry when you add a new one)
-   Allow the agent to set environment variables for itself that are hydrated every session
-   Better plugin architecture/extensibility
